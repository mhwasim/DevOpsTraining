Agile & DevOps

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid releases. It arose in the early 2000s from the software development industry, helping development teams react and adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands.

DevOps is an approach to software development that enables teams to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably by incorporating agile principles and practices, such as increased automation and improved collaboration between development and operations teams. Development, testing, and deployment occur in both agile and DevOps. Yet traditional agile stops short of operations, which is an integral part of DevOps. 

DevOps is not a replacement. But, it is a direct successor to Agile. Similar to how with time, practices get better; over time, Agile has also grown its challenges, and DevOps has turned out to be the more optimized practice.
